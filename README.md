# AI31
AI31 is a project for a java game.

The goal of the game is to score the highest. To do you, you swap one card at a time, going clockwise, until someone decides to pass, calling for a final turn of the round.

# How do the turns go?
The first player (the one to the left of the dealer) can decide to either keep their hand or swap it out with the middle hand. Afterwards, each player in turn has three options: swapping one card, swapping all three cards and passing, or just passing.
